This version of the IRIX XML Schemas has some changes from the original version published in March 2013
=======================================================================================================

- All 'anonymous' xsd types replaced with named types, to allow them to be easliy redefined in customized IRIX schemas
- Removed a superfluous xsd:choice element in Annexes.xsd (to fix a likely mistake in the original XML schemas)
